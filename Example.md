The TransactionManager must be brought fully Online by calling RecoverTransactionManager to recover to the end of its LogFile before objects in its Transaction or ResourceManager namespaces can be opened.  In addition, errors in writing records to its LogFile can cause a TransactionManager to go offline. |

Only the root of the Transaction can be enlisted on as a superior. |

| `ERROR_TRANSACTION_MUST_WRITETHROUGH` | `6729` | `0x1a49` | The transaction cannot be enlisted on with the specified EnlistmentMask, because the transaction has already completed the PrePrepare phase.  In order to ensure correctness, the ResourceManager must switch to a write-through mode and cease caching data within this transaction.  Enlisting for only subsequent transaction phases may still succeed. |

| `ERROR_HANDLE_NO_LONGER_VALID` | `6815` | `0x1a9f` | The handle has been invalidated by a transaction. The most likely cause is the presence of memory mapping on a file or an open handle when the transaction ended or rolled back to savepoint. |
| `ERROR_NO_TXF_METADATA` | `6816` | `0x1aa0` | There is no transaction metadata on the file. |

| `ERROR_RM_DISCONNECTED` | `6819` | `0x1aa3` | The transaction outcome is unavailable because the resource manager responsible for it has disconnected. |
| `ERROR_ENLISTMENT_NOT_SUPERIOR` | `6820` | `0x1aa4` | The request was rejected because the enlistment in question is not a superior enlistment. |

| `ERROR_CANT_BREAK_TRANSACTIONAL_DEPENDENCY` | `6824` | `0x1aa8` | The operation cannot be performed because another transaction is depending on the fact that this property will not change. |
| `ERROR_CANT_CROSS_RM_BOUNDARY` | `6825` | `0x1aa9` | The operation would involve a single file with two transactional resource managers and is therefore not allowed. |
| `ERROR_TXF_DIR_NOT_EMPTY` | `6826` | `0x1aaa` | The $Txf directory must be empty for this operation to succeed. |
| `ERROR_INDOUBT_TRANSACTIONS_EXIST` | `6827` | `0x1aab` | The operation would leave a transactional resource manager in an inconsistent state and is therefore not allowed. |
| `ERROR_TM_VOLATILE` | `6828` | `0x1aac` | The operation could not be completed because the transaction manager does not have a log. |

## New HResult Layout

HResult is a 32-bit number (`long` in C, `int` in C# and some other languages) laid out as follows:

```
 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
+-+-+-+-+-+---------------------+-------------------------------+
|S|R|C|N|r|    Facility         |               Code            |
+-+-+-+-+-+---------------------+-------------------------------+
```

| Name | Description
| :----- | :----- |
| `S` | Severity, `0 = Success`, `1 = Fail (Error)` |
| `R` | Reserved portion of the facility code, corresponds to NT's second severity bit |
| `C` | Reserved portion of the facility code, corresponds to NT's C field |
| `N` | Reserved portion of the facility code. Used to indicate a mapped NT status value |
| `r` | Reserved portion of the facility code. Reserved for internal use. Used to indicate HRESULT values that are not status values, but are instead message ids for display strings |
| `Facility` | Facility code |
| `Code` | Facility's status code |
